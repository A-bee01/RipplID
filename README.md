## 📍 Overview

RipplID is a naming service for the XRP Ledger. It allows users to register a unique name to their XRP Ledger address. This name can then be used to send and receive payments on the XRP Ledger. RipplID is built on the XRP Ledger, and uses the XRP Ledger's decentralized exchange to facilitate payments. RipplID is a decentralized application (dApp) that runs on the XRPL protocol. XRPL is a protocol that allows developers to build dApps on the XRP Ledger. XRPL is built on the Interledger Protocol (ILP), which allows for interoperability between different blockchains.

## 📦 Features

- **Enhanced User Experience**: `RipplID seeks to improve the user experience on the XRP Ledger by replacing complex wallet addresses with human-readable names. Users can register names like "YourName.ppl" or "YourBrand.ppl" and associate them with their XRPL wallet addresses.`
- **Simplified Payments**: `RipplID will simplify payments on the XRPL. Instead of sharing lengthy addresses, users can send funds to friends or businesses using their unique RipplID names, making transactions more user-friendly.`
- **Personal Branding**: `RipplID allows individuals, businesses, and content creators to establish their presence on the XRPL by registering names like "YourBrand.ppl" or "YourUsername.ppl." This enables personal branding and recognition within the XRPL community.`
- **Enhanced Security**: `RipplID will implement robust security measures to ensure the integrity of the naming system. Users will have control over their names and extensions, with options for multi-signature verification and domain management.`
