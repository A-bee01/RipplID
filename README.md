# XNS - XRPL Name Service
## What is XNS?
XNS is a name service for the XRPL. It allows users to register names and associate them with XRPL addresses. This allows users to send payments to other users using a name instead of an address. XNS is a decentralized name service, meaning that it does not rely on a central authority to operate. Instead, it uses the XRPL to store and distribute name data. This means that XNS is censorship resistant and cannot be taken down by any single entity. XNS is also open source, meaning that anyone can contribute to the project.

## How The Codebase Is Organized
The codebase is organized into two main parts: the backend and the frontend. The backend is written in JavaScript and uses the Firestore for DB management and XRP Ledger JavaScript SDK. The frontend is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend is responsible for handling requests from the frontend and interacting with the XRPL. The frontend is responsible for displaying the user interface and sending requests to the backend.
